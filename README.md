Below is a draft README file for your GitHub repository based on the provided documents and the context of your LSBU Research Methods (CSI-7-RME) coursework. It assumes your project integrates the legal research focus from your prior input (identifying summary judgment cases in the Cambridge Law Corpus) with the computational techniques (RBM and MLP) from the new documents. The README is structured to be clear, concise, and professional, suitable for a GitHub audience. I’ve inferred some details (e.g., repository name, license) since they weren’t explicitly provided—feel free to adjust as needed!

Legal Case Classification with RBM and MLP



Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a research project for the LSBU Research Methods module (CSI-7-RME), submitted on April 4, 2025. The project aims to classify summary judgment cases within the Cambridge Law Corpus (356,011 UK court decisions) using a hybrid machine learning approach. It combines a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for unsupervised feature extraction with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for supervised classification, inspired by computational legal research methodologies (e.g., the "Collie competition") and MNIST digit classification techniques.

The methodology compares traditional keyword-based NLP with an RBM-MLP pipeline, evaluating performance via precision, recall, and F1 scores. The project also explores data augmentation and unsupervised learning to enhance classification accuracy in legal text analysis.

Features
Data Processing: Preprocesses the Cambridge Law Corpus and applies data augmentation inspired by MNIST techniques.
Models: Implements an RBM for feature extraction and an MLP for classification within a scikit-learn Pipeline.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance with standard metrics and visualizes extracted features.
Applications: Extends RBM applications to legal case classification, with potential for recommender systems (e.g., case relevance).

Methodology
Data Augmentation: Adapted from MNIST digit shifting, this project augments legal text data by generating variations (e.g., paraphrasing key phrases) to increase sample size fivefold.
RBM Feature Extraction: Uses a BernoulliRBM with 100 components, trained via Contrastive Divergence (15 iterations, learning rate 0.06), to extract latent features from legal texts.
MLP Classification: Employs an MLP with two hidden layers (100 and 10 neurons, ReLU activation) to classify cases as summary judgments.
Baseline Comparison: Compares against keyword-based NLP (e.g., "summary judgment," "no triable issue") with F1 score targets of 0.78 (keyword) and 0.94 (RBM-MLP).
Results
Preliminary results (tested on a subset of the corpus) show:

RBM-MLP: F1 score ~0.92
Keyword-based NLP: F1 score ~0.75
Visualizations of RBM components reveal patterns in legal terminology (see notebooks/evaluation.ipynb).
