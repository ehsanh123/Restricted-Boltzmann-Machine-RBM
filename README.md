RBM and Deep Learning Tutorial
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) combined with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for digit classification using the MNIST dataset, along with lecture notes on Boltzmann Machines and their applications. The code demonstrates data augmentation, model training, and evaluation, while the accompanying documents provide theoretical background and tasks for further exploration.

Overview
The project consists of three main components:

Code: A Jupyter notebook-style Python implementation that trains an RBM and MLP pipeline on the MNIST digits dataset.
Tutorial Document: A step-by-step guide with OCR-extracted code snippets and explanations for the implementation.
Lecture Notes: Slides from a lecture on Boltzmann Machines, Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), and their applications, including recommender systems.
The implementation includes:

Data augmentation to increase the dataset size by shifting images.
Training an RBM to extract features, followed by an MLP classifier.
Evaluation of model accuracy on the test set.
